##Features Implemented:

- Mesh ðŸ’¡:
    - Use an external .obj file for polygons

- Primitive Shapes ðŸ‘‡:
    - `cone cx cy cz r h` : creates a cone centered at cx cy cz with height h
    - `pyramid cx cy cz b h` : creates a pyramid centered at cx cy cz with base b and height h
    - `cylinder cx cy cz r h` : creates a cylinder centered at cx cy cz with radius r and height h

- Changed behavior of vary:
    - Exponential : `vary spinny 0 49 0 1 exponential`
    - Logarithmic : `vary spinny 0 49 0 1 logarithmic`
